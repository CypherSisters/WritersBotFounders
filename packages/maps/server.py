"""Maps: draws what Manuscript has already read about a novel, big, in the window's side pane.

One small server, bound to 127.0.0.1:
- ``/``                        the page (web/index.html) and its files
- ``/health``                  "ok"
- ``/api/list``                GET: manuscripts that have a story bible, with their boards
- ``/api/atlas``               GET ``?title=``: the manuscript's front page as data: cast, world pins, family, story
                               cards and cover, each with its picture id or null and its proof: the bible's
                               evidence, with sections, that told the picture program what to paint (atlas.py)
- ``/api/illustrate``          GET ``?title=``: the progress of Illustrate; POST ``{title, minor}``: paints what the
                               manuscript needs, one at a time, skipping what is already painted (``maps_illustrate``)
- ``/api/style``               POST ``{title, style}``: the manuscript's style line (empty: the picture maker's style)
- ``/api/bible``               GET ``?title=``: the story bible
- ``/api/boards``              GET ``?title=`` (saved boards) or ``?title=&id=`` (one board; the standard eight are
                               built from the bible each time); DELETE ``?title=&id=``
- ``/api/draw``                POST ``{title, kind, asked}``: a new board, saved (the same as ``maps_draw``)
- ``/api/boards/<id>/layout``  POST ``{title, positions}``: dragged positions, saved
- ``/api/point``               POST ``{title, section, quote, note}``: Manuscript's page scrolls there
- ``/api/maker``               GET: the picture program's address, the style tail and the last ask's state;
                               POST ``{address, style}``: saved in this package's data folder, then the address asked for
- ``/api/maker/test``          POST: asks for the address again, then reaches the picture program and says what it has
- ``/api/picture``             POST ``{title, kind, who, event, note}``: a new picture, made in the background (the
                               same as ``maps_picture``); ``{title, retry: id}`` makes a failed one again;
                               ``{title, again: id, note}`` paints that one again with the writer's note
- ``/api/pictures``            GET ``?title=``: the pictures; DELETE ``?title=&id=``
- ``/api/picture/<id>.png``    GET ``?title=``: the picture file
- ``/mcp``                     the MCP server (JSON-RPC over HTTP)

Every route refuses a request without this package's PUFFPAI_TOKEN. GET never changes anything.

Where the files are: ``<data folder>\\My files\\Manuscripts\\<title>\\``, found by asking the Core where My files is
(``GET /v1/owner-files``). Maps reads only ``bible.json``, ``views.json``, ``boards.json``, ``corrections.json`` and
``pointer.json`` there, and writes only ``boards.json``, ``pointer.json``, ``pictures.json`` (the pictures and each
character's and place's fixed seed), ``style.json``, ``illustrate.json`` and ``pictures\\<id>.png``. It
never reads or writes section text. No brain calls: every board is built from the bible by fixed rules (draw.py), and
every picture is painted by a picture program (ComfyUI) on another computer on the home network, from a prompt built
from bible facts only (pictures.py). Its own data folder (PUFFPAI_DATA) holds ``maker.json``: that address, the style
and the last ten picture times, for Illustrate's time line.
