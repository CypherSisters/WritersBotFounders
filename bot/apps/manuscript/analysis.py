"""The reading: your bot reads the whole manuscript, section by section, and builds the story bible (CONTRACT.md).

Every model call goes through the Core's ``POST /v1/brain/chat`` with the package token, so the words stay on this
computer. The brain on the owner's computer is small (about 8,192 tokens of context), so each ask is kept under about
5,000 tokens of input, counted roughly as 1.4 tokens a word, and asks for compact JSON.

1. Extract: two calls per section, JSON only. The first, with the names already known, for the facts (people,
   places, events and where each sits in the story's time, threads, themes, science, continuity). The second for how
   it is told (scenes and their purpose, point of view, tense, slips, tics, dialogue habits); word counts, dialogue
   share and how often a tic comes are counted here, not by the model. The facts ask also asks for the evidence for
   pictures (how people and places look, distances and directions, the era's visible marks); a section too long to
   carry that in the same ask gets a third, small ask for it instead, and so does a section cached before 0.3.3. ``<think>`` blocks are dropped before parsing;
   bad JSON gets one repair call, then the section is skipped with a note. Both are cached by the section's sha.
2. Merge: deterministic. The same name, an alias, or a first name that matches exactly one known character merges.
   Voice (point of view and tense by section, tics, dialogue habits) is put together here, by counting.
3. Synthesize: an arc call per character with four or more appearances, one call for threads and continuity, one for
   themes, one for the story order of the events, one for the structure, one for the editor's desk. Each gets the
   merged facts, never the whole text.
4. ``bible.json`` is written after every step and ``status.json`` is kept current. Before each write the writer's own
   corrections and desk choices are put back on top (the ``after`` hook). Nothing here writes a section.
